EVTDESC4413218;It is no secret that America has a troubled history regarding the enslavement of Africans. There are those who would argue that only through providing African Americans with their own autonomous region will the wrongs of the country’s past be corrected. However, others assert that doing so would only isolate African Americans and fail to properly address their problems.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESC44132189;The next step in the formation of the New African autonomous region is establishing its borders. There are three possibilities of varying sizes, each larger than the last.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;

EVTDESC4413221;In the recent years, New Africa has become a great power and one that, many argue, should expand. Plans have been drafted for liberation of workers of the rich sugar plantations dotted across the islands of the Caribbean. Although perhaps the destiny of New Africa rests in the lands of the American South where our enslaved ancestors once toiled.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESC4413222;A recent effort has been made in New Africa to integrate the black and white population.  Although there is a disagreement as to what extent integration should be attempted. While it is agreeable to most for the extension of rights to Northern immigrants or so-called Yankees, there is a great deal of discomfort at the thought of extending rights to Southerners that once practiced slavery. No matter the choice, the far right elements are bound to protest.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;

underground_railroad_NAF_desc;The National Underground Railroad Institute works to integrate escaped slaves into New Africa while also operating secret networks to free slaves across the South.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,
EVTDESC44132223;Soon after its establishment, the New African government founded the National Underground Railroad Institute. While its official public function is to assist with the settlement of escaped slaves into New Africa, the Institute, as suggested by its less than subtle name, secretly works with abolitionists to help slaves escape bondage from the American South and flee to New Africa. There are also rumors that the Institute funds and organizes slave revolts; however, the Institute denies such accusations.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESC44132224;With slavery no longer the menace it once was, The National Underground Railroad Institute no longer has a purpose and as such as has been officially closed.

EVTDESC44132225;New Africa is a nation of free people who once endured systematic violence and forced servitude. Now that the racial hierarchy of power has inverted, those that once sat at the top are resentful of their current low standing. As such, racial tensions are high in provinces that lack a black majority.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESC44132226;Due to the lack of a black majority, $PROVINCENAME$ is experiencing significant racial tensions that will only subside as more African Americans and other accepted cultures settle in the area. This unrest will most likely spread throughout White majority provinces.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;

EVTDESC44132228;A man of both African and Indian heritage, John Horse fought alongside Seminole tribes against the United States Army during the Second Seminole War. He garnered a reputation as a skilled scout and talented negotiator, and Horse soon became a prominent leader among the Seminole people. After New Africa passed the Seminole Act, which integrated Indian tribes in Florida, John Horse offered his service and expertise to the army of New Africa.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESC44132229;In $YEAR$ onboard the brig Creole, Madison Washington, an enslaved cook, led his fellow slaves in a revolt against their captors who were transporting them to an American slave market. After killing the ship's captain, they seized control of the vessel. Although they were initially planning to sail for Nassau, they have instead arrived at a New African port. The most apparent course of action is to welcome Washington and the other slaves as heroes. However, doing so will undoubtedly enrage the United States, which would accuse New Africa of harboring criminals.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESC44132230; Uncle Remus: His Songs and His Sayings is a collection of African American folktales that author Joel Chandler Harris recalled from his childhood on his family's plantation in Georgia. Although New Africa has since liberated Georgia, many Southern whites, like Harris, still hold on dearly to their memories during the time of slavery, and as such, Harris's book has quickly become a best-seller and favorite among the white community in New Africa. However, the character of Uncle Remus has received a very mixed reaction from black New Africans. While it is impossible to ignore the rich collection of folklore Harris has been able to compile, there are many, especially among the intellectual class, who are critical of what they believe to be a romanticization of slavery and accuse Harris of cultural theft. The New African government can either curtail the distribution of Harris's work or allow it circulate openly.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESC44132231;Born into bondage in 1818, Fredrick Douglass escaped slavery at a young age and fleed from Maryland to New Africa. He has quickly gained notoriety for his skill as an orator and controversy for his staunch support of racial and gender equality. While most in New Africa view him as the country’s most important statesman, few entirely embrace his radical proposal for the greater social and political integration of whites in New Africa. However, his most recent publication, A Narrative of New Africa, has enticed many New Africans into his Equality Party and led to an increased acceptance of the notion for greater equality among the races.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESC44132232;The legend ofJohn Henry is the tale of one man with raw strength and incredible endurance beating a steam-powered machine in a competition to drill a tunnel through a mountain. Although where precisely this competition occurred and whether if such a man even existed is debatable, there is no denying that John Henry has become an inspiring symbol of the industrial New African man. Additionally, his hammer-wielding image has become closely associated with socialist parties and trade unions, especially those composed of railway workers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESC44132233;Prominent academic and founder of the Tuskegee Institute Booker T. Washington has always been known as a moderate voice in New African politics, and he frequently opposes war waged at the expense of various domestic reforms, especially those related to education. Washington recently gave a speech to a large crowd in $CAPITAL$. In the speech, he called for the development of greater respect and the reduction of tensions between whites and blacks in New Africa. Furthermore, Washington argued for better relations between New Africa and the United States and proposed a compromise in which New Africa would cease territorial expansion into the American South in return for an increase in trade and protection from the United States.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;

EVTDESC44132218;Several candidate cities would serve as suitable locations for the new capital of New Africa. Located in the along the Louisiana coast, New Orleans has long been the cultural capital of the country. Montgomery's central location would make it an appropriate city for the capital to be seated, and its small size allows for some room to develop. Lastly, Atlanta is one of the largest cities in New Africa and is the economic heart of the country.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESC44132219;In 1831, Nat Turner led a slave rebellion in Virginia that was composed of more than 70 slaves and resulted in the death of 60 white people, including women and children. After Nat Turner was captured and the rebellion ended, over a hundred slaves were massacred in retaliation. For many in New Africa, Nat Turner represents the heroism and determination needed to fight such a brutal system like slavery. However, whites in the country perceive Nat Turner as a violent murderer. With the 100th Anniversary of the rebellion closely approaching, there is mounting pressure on the government on how to remember such a cataclysmic event and such a complicated man.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESC44132220;New Africa is currently experiencing a cultural renaissance emanating out of $CAPITAL$.
